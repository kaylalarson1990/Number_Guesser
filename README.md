By: Andreea Hanson &amp; Kayla Larson


JAVASCRIPT
Created two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within.
Set alert for when the user doesn't enter a number in the range fields.
for each player:
Added an input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values
Added an input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character
Added one button that submits both players guesses
